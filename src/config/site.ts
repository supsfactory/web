/**
 * Site configuration — single source of truth for all site-wide constants.
 *
 * This module defines the SITE_ID, domain, name, and other identifiers that
 * vary per product deployment. Code must import from here instead of
 * hardcoding brand names, domains, or Cloudflare resource names.
 *
 * Values are set at build time; runtime code reads them via the exported
 * constants. To deploy a new product, change these values (and the
 * corresponding Cloudflare/GitHub resources).
