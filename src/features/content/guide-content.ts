    intro: [
      'Choosing your first (or next) inflatable SUP comes down to a few decisions: board size, width, construction and what is included in the package. Here is what matters, in plain language.',
    ],
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Length and Volume',
        body: 'Longer boards (11–12 ft) glide farther per stroke and track straighter — ideal for touring and distance paddling. Shorter boards turn more easily. For most riders, an all-around 10\'6"–11\'0" board is the sweet spot.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Width and Stability',
        body: 'Width drives stability more than anything else. A 32-inch deck is forgiving for beginners and stable enough for yoga; 30-inch boards suit lighter or more experienced paddlers who want speed and agility.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Construction Quality',
        body: 'Look for a military-grade drop-stitch PVC core rated to at least 15 PSI, double-layer PVC lamination and reinforced rail bands. These determine how rigid the board feels and how long it lasts under daily use.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What Should Be in the Box',
        body: 'A complete package saves money and hassle: board, 3-piece adjustable paddle, dual-action pump with gauge, coiled leash, fin(s), travel backpack and a repair kit.',
      },
    ],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'What size SUP board do I need?', a: 'Most beginners choose an all-around board around 11\'0" × 32" × 6" — stable, versatile and easy to transport. Heavier riders or paddlers who want distance should size up.' },
      { q: 'Is an inflatable SUP as rigid as a hard board?', a: 'A modern drop-stitch inflatable at 15–20 PSI is close to an entry-level hard board in rigidity, with the advantage of packing into a backpack.' },
    ],
  },
  {
    slug: 'beginner-guide',
    title: "Beginner's Guide to Paddling",
    intro: [
      'Everything you need for your first sessions on the water: inflation, the first stand-up, the basic stroke, and how to stay safe while you build confidence.',
    ],
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Inflate to Spec, Not to Feel',
        body: 'Inflate to the rated pressure (typically 15 PSI) using the gauge on your pump. A board at 10 PSI feels fine on grass but flexes badly on the water. Check the pressure on warm days — sun heats the air inside and raises pressure.',
      },
      {
        title: 'First Steps On Board',
        body: 'Launch from a beach or shallow entry, kneel first, then stand one foot at a time over the center line. Keep your feet shoulder-width, knees soft, and look at the horizon — your board follows your eyes.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Basic Stroke',
        body: 'Reach forward with the paddle, plant the blade fully, and pull it alongside the board while rotating your torso. Switch sides every few strokes to go straight; use a few sweeps on one side to turn.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Practice the Fall First',
        body: 'Falling in is part of learning. Practice remounting in shallow water: swim to the center handle, kick your legs to the surface, and pull yourself onto the board in one motion.',
      },
    ],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'How long does it take to learn SUP?', a: 'Most people can paddle comfortably on flat water within their first hour-long session. Confidence with turns, wind and distance builds over a few sessions.' },
      { q: 'Do I need to be fit?', a: 'No — SUP is very accessible. You will naturally build balance, core strength and stamina with regular paddling.' },

    slug: 'inflatable-vs-hard',
    title: 'Inflatable vs Hard Board',
    intro: [
      'The two construction families each win in different scenarios. Here is the honest comparison for recreational paddlers, clubs and rental operators.',
    ],
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Portability and Storage',
        body: 'Inflatable boards deflate into a backpack that fits in a car trunk, RV or apartment closet — and they are the default choice for travel. Hard boards need roof racks, storage space and more careful handling.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Rigidity and Performance',
        body: 'Premium hard boards are stiffer and more responsive at high performance levels. At recreational speeds, a well-built drop-stitch inflatable at 15–20 PSI performs comparably for a fraction of the storage cost.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Durability',
        body: 'Inflatable PVC boards shrug off dock scrapes and shore impacts that would crack a hard shell — a key reason rental fleets and resorts choose inflatables for daily guest use.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Total Cost of Ownership',
        body: 'Inflatable boards cost less to ship, store and maintain, and they survive rougher handling. For most users and most fleets, an inflatable is the better all-around value.',
      },
    ],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Which is better for beginners?', a: 'Inflatable boards — stable, forgiving, easy to store, and durable enough for the scrapes beginners create.' },
      { q: 'Can an inflatable SUP be as fast as a hard board?', a: 'At recreational speeds the difference is small. Hard boards only clearly win in racing and high-performance scenarios.' },

    title: 'Water Safety Tips',
    intro: [
      'A safe session is a fun session. These basics apply to lakes, rivers and coastal paddling alike.',

    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Check Wind and Forecast',
        body: 'Offshore wind is the classic SUP trap: it pushes you away from shore faster than you can paddle back. Check the forecast, and when in doubt, stay within sheltered water.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Always Wear the Leash',
        body: 'A coiled leash keeps your board within reach if you fall — the board is your flotation device. Choose a leash matched to your conditions: coiled for flat water, straight for surf.',
      },
      {
        title: 'PFD and Personal Safety',
        body: 'Wear a buoyancy aid when conditions warrant it, or when regulations require it. Carry a whistle, tell someone your route and return time, and consider a phone in a waterproof pouch.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Know Your Limits',
        body: 'Build experience in flat water before wind or current. Respect cold water — it saps strength quickly. And never paddle alone in remote or open-water areas without a plan.',
      },
    ],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Do I need a life jacket on a SUP?', a: 'Requirements vary by country and waterway. Even where it is optional, a leash plus a buoyancy aid is the responsible baseline, and children should always wear a properly fitted PFD.' },
      { q: 'Is it safe to SUP in a lake?', a: 'Yes — flat lakes are ideal for learning. Check wind direction, stay visible to boat traffic, and avoid busy boating lanes.' },
